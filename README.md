# Epistemic-Filter-Framework
Official code for 'Epistemic Filtering for Neural Networks: Verifying Information Before Ingestion'. This repo provides the POC implementation of a novel pre-LLM verification framework. It assesses information's epistemic quality via semantic/logical analysis to mitigate hallucination. Includes code for multi-component scoring &amp; evaluation.
